# MVVMBasedProjectArchitecture

I have implemented MVVM in multiple projects with multiple variations and there are a lot of helpful articles available to understand the concepts . 
Every time I start a new project , I end up improving my previous MVVM implementation a little bit more . 
This is one version that I have recently worked on and I liked it , although It still is in progress and I will add some more useful classes and methods
to this repository as the project progresses. 

This is one article that I have followed : https://proandroiddev.com/demystifying-retrofit-network-call-with-kotlin-livedata-27437439137a

Some things that I will be adding soon : 
1. Correct way to use paging 
2. Handy Material Shapes method 
3. Same architecture with coroutine version
